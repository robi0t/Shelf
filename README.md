Shelf Programming Language
------------------------
A very simple interpreter that currently supports a few functions â†“ See [Examples](https://github.com/robi0t/Shelf/tree/main/examples)


Making a "Hello World" program 
------------------------
First create a .shf file\
The function to output text in the terminal is `say()`
```
say("Hello World");
```
Then you can run it with `./shelf(.exe) file.shf` 

Set a variable and say it
------------------------
The syntax to make a variable is `set variablename = "content";`
```
set name = "John Doe";
say(name);
```

Define a function and call it
------------------------
The syntax to make a function is `define functionname(arguments){};`
```
define _function(name){
  say(name);
};

_function("John Doe");
```
At the moment it does not support no arguments in a function, so you can use none, `define functionname(none)`

Wait until any key is pressed
------------------------
The function to wait until a key is pressed is `waitfkey()`
Example:
```
say("before");
waitfkey("Press any key to continue");
say("after");
```

Get user input
------------------------
The function to get user input is `readl()`
Example:
```
readl("Type your name > ");
```
Currently you cant store this into a variable
